# html_project
 
This repository contains projects where I work on different topics that relate to HTML coding. Here are collected either the Landing Page, or small projects, where, for example, I train semantics.

1) site_io - this is one of my first projects where I just tried to write a landing page with no experience

2) trening_html1 - in this project, I paid attention to architecture and learned how to connect cards on the page with radio buttons. In addition, I learned about sprites and what they are for.

3) site_selector - for this project, I chose a simple layout, but I had a certain goal: semantics training
